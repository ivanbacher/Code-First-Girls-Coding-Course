Code First: Girls - Session 2 - HTML + CSS

Quick recap:

A web page is just a collection of files (HTML, CSS, and JS) that can be editied locally (on your own computer) using a text editor (Sublime, Atom, Notepad++) and viewed using a browser.

<!-- This is a comment in HTML, this will be ignored by the browser when rendering the web page -->
<!-- Use comments to add additional information to the HTML file -->

/* This is a comment in CSS, the browser will ignore these lines */
